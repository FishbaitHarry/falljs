# FallJS

## Important

Work in progress. Not ready for (any) use.

## What is this?

This is supposed to be a lightweight dependency injection container for JS.
So it's something like Spring, but for javascript.

## Mission

To reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to write Nodejs microservices.
Please note that currently it is already very low (compared to Java), but there
is always room for improvement!

## Random notes

This version relies internally on Promises.
In future, I might switch to callbacks for better performance.
